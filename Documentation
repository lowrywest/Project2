MesoAbstract
Create the claAverage method and the letterAverage method in the Abstract class.
Leave the two methods empty with public abstract followed by the return type and the method name.

MesoInherit
I created two global variables. The first is an array of char values that holds the value at every position of the string and the second is
an array of ints to hold the values of the ASCII floor, ceil, and avg. 

Constructor
The constructor makes the MesoInherit object and has the input of the MesoStation object. Then I made a String to hold the value from the 
Mesostation getStid method which returns the 4 letter string. Then I set the value of the global array to the value of the getStid String.

claAverage 
I made a Double variable to hold the ASCII average value from the array of chars. Then I set the first value in the int array to the ceil
value of the average variable. Next I set the second value in the int array to the floor value of the average variable. Then I used an if 
statement to detrmine wether the value after the decimal point in the average value was less than 0.5 and if so set the floor value to the 
third value in the int array if it is greater than or equal to that value then the third value in the int array is set to the ceil value.

letterAverage
I made a char variable and set that equal to the int value in the third location of the int array and then returned the corresponding char
value.
